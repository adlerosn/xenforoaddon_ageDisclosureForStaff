### Abandon Date

2016-06-03

### Scenario

In a board where dates between underage members is reason for banishment, people who runs the site needed to quickly know if both members should be banned from the site or just assigned infraction points, actions these which are both performed by a moderator or administrator.

### Solution

An add-on that modifies the default behavior, allowing selected members to override user privacy over "age" attribute in one click on any link that contains the user name.
